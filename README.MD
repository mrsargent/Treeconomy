# Tree - economy

## Introduction 

In today’s increasingly digital world, the integration of physical assets with blockchain technology offers transformative opportunities across industries. Tracking the journey of physical items as they progress through various stages of production, or in our case, from volunteer-collected seed to a fully grown tree at a restoration site, has traditionally been cumbersome, opaque, and inefficient. Current systems often lack the transparency and security needed for stakeholders to trace the origin and history of materials or products. This is especially true in environmental initiatives, where tracking tools are prone to errors in both reporting and validation—issues that undermine the credibility of emissions tracking systems and hinder funders and volunteers from accurately assessing the impact of activities such as forest restoration.
 
In restoration projects, there is a pressing need to track critical data points, such as whether forests are being planted with regionally appropriate seeds, the current and future capacity of nurseries and farms, the location and number of plantings being supplied by differing seed stocks, and, importantly, whether the planted trees continue to grow. Additionally, understanding how much carbon these trees store and the other benefits they provide—such as food, economic value, and biodiversity—is vital for both people and the environment, but can’t occur without the forest restoration logistical solution we are proposing in this whitepaper. 
 
Not all trees grow to maturity, and not all tree-planting campaigns succeed. Tracking tree seed collection, planting, and growth over time can help governments, companies, and NGOs assess progress on public pledges, replicate successful projects by providing methods for collecting and replacing missing data, provide empirical evidence for program metrics, allow evidenced based assessments of effectiveness, provide guideposts for effective program implementation and best practices, and inspire funders to continue supporting initiatives where past progress is clearly documented.
 
Our project harnesses blockchain technology to create an innovative system where physical items, like seeds collected by volunteers, are registered at the start of their lifecycle and meticulously tracked as they progress from seed to tree. At each stage of this journey, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are minted to represent the item's status, generating a transparent and immutable record enriched with metadata that answers critical questions. This system not only enhances transparency in the supply chain but also incentivizes participants by rewarding stakeholders at key milestones, making the process more engaging and rewarding for all involved.
 
By embedding visibility and verification into the process—from seed to tree—we empower volunteers, community members, and stakeholders to actively participate in the creation and monitoring of these restoration projects. Using blockchain’s decentralized ledger, every step in the item’s lifecycle is securely recorded, verifiable, and tamper-proof. Our solution provides the trust and accountability needed to drive meaningful change in both supply chains and environmental restoration efforts, while creating new opportunities for value generation through NFTs and milestone-based recognition.

## Problem Statement

Forest restoration logistics are inefficient, do not scale well, and do not have the required security, and verifiability. 
    • It’s hard to track seed collection sites/locations/stocks and give credit to volunteers
    • Its hard to know which seeds end up becoming saplings and where they are being stored.
    • Its hard to verify that plantings have regionally appropriate tree species in the correct composition for the local ecosystem. 
    • It’s hard to recall where all the different types of trees are planted over time
    • Its complicated to verify if a tree is still there later (this might not be in this project). 
    • People are not recognized for their volunteer activity, funders don’t have long-term tracking of outcomes, and nurseries can’t incentivize high-quality seed collection. 
    • Some individual projects do track tree growth, but each project follows its own method, and the type and quality of data vary greatly. Much of this data is not independently verified, and only spans the first few years of the project (before the trees fully mature). This project would fix that?
